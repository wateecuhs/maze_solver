# Maze solver

Personal project i made to learn C and algorithms.

After doing it in C, I wanted to learn how to do web dev so i tried doing it.
Code and the languages used might be very suboptimal but it is what it is.

(Design is heavily inspired by [this one](https://angeluriot.com/maze_solver/))
